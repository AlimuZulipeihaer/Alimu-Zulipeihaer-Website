        <p class="lead mb-4">I am an International student from University of California, Riverside, and I was embarking on my own journey to study economics.
        During my years at UCR, I took courses such as International Finance, Industrial Organization, as well as a series of accounting and statistics classes.
        While I was captivated by the subject matter, leading me to earn a 3.8 GPA, in 2019 Spring, a personal accident happened. I could not take any midterm exam during quarter,
        which took a toll on my grade. Now that the situation has subsided and wonâ€™t come back, I am more focused and devoted to my studies, not just to repair the 
        damages on my grades but prepare myself for graduate school as well.
<br><br>

       My parentsâ€™ background as business owner play a crucial role for me in determining area of graduate study.
       Since childhood, I witnessed not only how they built their business from scratch to an international corporation
       but also how to manage it while serving a series of executive capacities at once. One aspect that really stood out
       to me is their efforts to promote their business and reach out to potential customers. Recent tensions in Sino-U.S. trade
       relations further encouraged me to study how to manage an organization and its marketing strategies on an international scale.
       However, since my undergraduate major is marketing, I decided to pursue a graduate degree on this subject.

<br><br>

        My future plan is going to graduate school, and among all the programs in marketing,I really want to go the Boston Universityâ€™s
        Metropolitan College, Master of Science in Global Marketing Management, stood out for two reasons. The first one is the programâ€™s
        curriculum and the other one is its support for career development. Through the programâ€™s courses, I would like to deepen my knowledge
        on the evolving forms of marketing techniques on social media, how to operate a businessâ€™ marketing strategy based on cultural and geopolitical
        differences and analyze socioeconomic environments with a global perspective. For future career development,â€¦ . Upon graduation, I plan to utilize
        BU Metropolitan Collegeâ€™s career center and its alumni network and start my career as a marketing analyst at an international corporation.
